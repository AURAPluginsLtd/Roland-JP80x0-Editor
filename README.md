Roland JP-80x0 Editor & Librarian is designed to control your Roland JP-8000 / JP-8080 right from your DAW. With our Editor, you can work with your Roland JP-8000 / JP-8080 by the same way you use your virtual instrument plug-ins. Our Editor will recall your patch settings when you open your project and the data will be sent to your JP-8000 / JP-8080 automatically once you open your project. Your synthesizer is always synchronized with your session! The only thing you need to worry, is that you power-up your synthesizer.
